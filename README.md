# Bootstrap-WP-Comment-Walker
Bootstrap WP Comment Walker

This is one example of Walker_Comment with the [Bootstrap media object style](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media)

I try to find in the web some example of this, but i really didn't find anything, so i make my own, this one is use in [Basico Theme](https://github.com/nicearma/basico-theme) 

The code use the [Wordpress Walker Class](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/Walker) and the HTML of the Boostrap media Object.

For the moment have some variables Basico Theme, but is easy to understand, so you can modify and use in any project you want.

The ping back option is not tested at this moment.
